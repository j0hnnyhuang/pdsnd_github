### Project Title
Exploring US Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project uses Pandas and NumPy to allow users to see different statistics
based on different inputs that YOU, the user, input. The program will ask you
which city you would like to find out more information on (Chicago, New York
City, Washington) and if you want to filter by month, day, or neither. Based on
those inputs, the program will allow you to see the actual data from the first
six months of 2017, along with certain statistics that may be beneficial to the
user. Check it out for yourself!
